A multiplatform SwiftUI framework inspired by [Luminare](https://github.com/MrKai77/Luminare), designed for iOS, visionOS, tvOS, watchOS, and macOS.
It recreates the look, feel, and structure of Luminare without relying on AppKit-only features.

## ⚡️ Why MobileLuminare?

`Luminare` is powerful but macOS-only. `MobileLuminare` brings the same mindset and structure to iOS and other SwiftUI platforms with platform-safe code.  
Use it when you want:

- ✅ Only some UI elements to be Lumianre, not the whole window
- ✅ Clean, consistent elements
- ✅ Code that feels like Luminare
- ✅ Add MobileLumianre to an existing multiplatform app

---

## 📦 Installation

### Swift Package Manager

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/omeriadon/MobileLuminare.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

or

Import `https://github.com/omeriadon/MobileLuminare` from Xcode > File > Add Package Dependencies...

Then import it:

```swift
import MobileLuminare
```

---

## ⏳ Future

- After Luminare updates to v2, I'll try to merge this repo into Luminare
   - This will mean that all macOS functionality is retained but on other platforms a similar version is used instead
